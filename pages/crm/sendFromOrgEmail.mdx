Solution for the 
"Email can't be sent using this from address.Kindly check the allowed from address list"
error:

If you're getting that error, try this:

In the data map that you are sending to the ".../actions/send_mail" url, include:
dataMap = map();
dataMap.put("org_email", true);
dataMap.put("from":{"user_name":"John Doe", "email":"senderEmail@mydomain.com"});
// ...
dataMap.put("subject", ...);
dataMap.put("template", ...);

As long as your 'from' address is set up in CRM Channels>Emails>Organization Emails, and you include the key-value pairs I mentioned above, then this should resolve the error.
